# algorithms-with-crystal [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yefremov/algorithms-with-crystal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yefremov/algorithms-with-crystal)

This is a collection of different algorithms written in Crystal. The purpose of this package is to define basic algorithms in a concise, but readable form. However, no (pre)mature optimizations should be expected here and code should never be used in production.
